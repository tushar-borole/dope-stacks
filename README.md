   to run in _all common cluster environments_, perform computations at
   in-memory speed_ and at _any scale_ 
  - [bazel.build](https://bazel.build/) : Build and test software of any size, quickly and reliably






## Contributing

Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions with the guide, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository. If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google. Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.
